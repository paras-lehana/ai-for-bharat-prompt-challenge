🌾 Introducing Multilingual Mandi: Breaking Language Barriers in Indian Agriculture 🇮🇳

I'm excited to share my latest project - a voice-first agricultural marketplace that's making digital trading accessible to India's 146 million farmers!

📊 THE PROBLEM WE'RE SOLVING:

Despite government initiatives like eNAM, only 15% of farmers use digital platforms. Why? Language is the #1 barrier - 75% of farmers prefer local languages over English/Hindi. Additionally:
• 85.83% complain about low prices on existing platforms
• 80.83% report trader cartels manipulating markets
• 71.67% say prices don't match quality
• 54.16% are uncomfortable with one-time auction systems

💡 OUR SOLUTION:

Multilingual Mandi doesn't replace eNAM - we make it accessible. We're the first platform combining voice interaction, AI-powered negotiation, and transparent pricing in local languages.

🔗 POWERFUL INTEGRATIONS:

✅ SARVAM AI - Speech-to-text and text-to-speech in 22 Indian languages
✅ OpenRouter (Qwen 3 VL) - Intent extraction and negotiation analysis
✅ eNAM Integration - Real-time government market data
✅ Docker - Scalable containerized deployment

🎯 KEY FEATURES:

🎤 Voice-First Interface - Speak in Marathi, Tamil, Telugu, or any of 22 Indian languages. No reading required!

💬 AI Negotiation Copilot - Smart counter-offer suggestions based on real market data. Back-and-forth negotiation, not one-time auctions.

📊 Transparent Quality-Based Pricing - Clear formula: Final Price = Base Price × Quality Multiplier × Demand Adjuster. No hidden charges!

🗺️ Peer Vendor Discovery - Find nearby farmers, collaborate on bulk orders, direct messaging without middlemen.

⭐ Smart Trust System - Transparent ratings (40% delivery, 30% quality, 20% response, 10% pricing) with AI-powered dispute resolution.

🔗 Government Integration - Pull live prices from eNAM, support for ODOP/GeM initiatives. We enhance, not replace.

📈 Multilingual Advisory - Market intelligence in your local language. Price alerts, seasonal guidance, weather updates.

🛡️ Secure Authentication - Phone-based OTP login, JWT tokens, role-based access control.

📱 Mobile-First Design - Responsive from 320px to 1920px, works on any device.

🤖 AI-Powered Features - Listing generation, negotiation analysis, dispute resolution, all powered by advanced AI.

📊 IMPACT POTENTIAL:

• Target: 60-70% farmer adoption (vs 15% for eNAM)
• Income Boost: ₹5,000-10,000 extra per season per farmer
• Market Access: Direct buyer connections, eliminating middleman exploitation

🛠️ TECH STACK:

Frontend: React.js, Tailwind CSS, Web Speech API
Backend: Node.js, Express.js, SQLite/PostgreSQL
AI/ML: SARVAM AI (STT/TTS), OpenRouter (Qwen 3 VL)
Infrastructure: Docker, Docker Compose

🎯 WHAT MAKES US UNIQUE:

1. First platform with voice + 22 local languages
2. First platform with AI-assisted negotiation (not auction)
3. First platform with transparent quality-based pricing
4. First platform integrating (not replacing) government portals
5. First platform with peer discovery and micro-aggregation

💪 CURRENT STATUS:

✅ MVP Complete - All 7 core features implemented
