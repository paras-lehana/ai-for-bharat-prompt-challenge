## Overview

The Multilingual Mandi is a real-time linguistic bridge for local trade in India, designed to make agricultural trading accessible to 146 million farmers by providing:

- **Voice-based price discovery** in 6 local languages
- **AI-driven negotiation** support with fair pricing
- **Transparent quality-based pricing** formula
- **Peer vendor discovery** and micro-aggregation
- **Smart trust system** with dispute resolution
- **Integration** with eNAM, ODOP, GeM platforms
- **Multilingual advisory** and market intelligence

## Problem Statement

Only 15% of Indian farmers use digital trading platforms like eNAM. The #1 barrier is language - 75% of farmers prefer their local language over English/Hindi.

## Our Solution

We don't replace eNAM - we make it accessible. First platform combining voice + local languages + AI negotiation + transparent pricing.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express.js
- **Database**: SQLite (MVP) / PostgreSQL (Production)
- **APIs**: BHASHINI for multilingual support, eNAM for market data
