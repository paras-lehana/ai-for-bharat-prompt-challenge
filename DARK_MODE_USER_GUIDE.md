The theme toggle is always visible in the navigation bar on every page. You never need to go to Settings to switch themes manually.

### Tip 2: Automatic Modes
Only one automatic mode can be active at a time:
- If you enable "Auto Dark Mode", "Time-Based Mode" turns off
- If you enable "Time-Based Mode", "Auto Dark Mode" turns off
- If you manually toggle the theme, both automatic modes turn off

### Tip 3: Battery Saving
Dark mode can save battery on OLED/AMOLED screens (most modern smartphones). Enable it to extend battery life!

### Tip 4: Eye Comfort
Dark mode reduces eye strain in low-light environments. Use it at night or in dark rooms for better comfort.

Both themes maintain high contrast for readability. Choose whichever is more comfortable for your eyes.
